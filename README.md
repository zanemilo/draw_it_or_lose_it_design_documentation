  The Gaming Room is a company interested in developing a web-based game that serves many different platforms. Their goal was to expand their game to be available on more devices than just Android. They required the game be able to handle multiplayer with features such as one or more teams, unique IDs for games, teams and players to prevent conflicts and to ensure only one game instance exists in memory as any time. I did well with identifying the requirements and constraints in technical and non-technical ways. I excelled at analyzing different operating systems and development environments to help pin point the best suited architecture to fit the project needs.
  
  Working through a design document helps to structure the development process. It acts as a blueprint that aligns the development with the client’s requirements and constraints. By outlining the system architecture, domain model, and potential issues beforehand, it ensures that the coding phase is focused on implementation.
  
  If a part were to be revised, it could be the 'Evaluation' section where operating systems are analyzed. This section could be expanded to include more specific examples of tools and libraries compatible with each OS, and how these could directly benefit the game development. Including more detailed case studies or examples of similar projects could also provide clearer guidance and assurance of the recommendations made.
  
  The user's needs were interpreted through the requirements for a unique, scalable, and responsive gaming experience. These needs were considered and embedded into the design by choosing technologies and architectures that support real-time interactions and scalable cloud services. Considering the user’s needs is paramount because it ensures the product will be easy to use, meet the expected functionalities, and be accepted by the target audience.
  
  The approach that I took to designing the software involved an analysis of user requirements, system constraints, and the evaluation of various technological solutions. Techniques such as modular design, use of design patterns like Singleton for managing game instances, and object-oriented principles for system design were critical. In the future, continuing to use these structured methodologies will be beneficial. Additionally, incorporating agile development practices for iterative testing and refinement, and involving user feedback early and regularly in the design process could enhance adaptability and user satisfaction.
